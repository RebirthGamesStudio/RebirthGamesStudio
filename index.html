        <Summary>v1.9.0</Summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</p>

          <p>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
